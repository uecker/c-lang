# Issues with Qualifiers #

* anonymous unions/structs
    Do qualifiers have an effect?
    
* struct/union members with qualifiers during struct assignment
    * there is no lvalue with qualifiers involved
    * for const there is a rule in the def. of 'modifiable lvalue'
    * volatile may be UB (has a volatile object modified using non-vol lv)
    * _Atomic ??
    * also: Unnamed members of structure objects have indeterminate value even after initialization.
