### Auto ###

C++ has auto. Compilers support __auto_type as an extension

  auto x = 3;


C23 will add auto.
  
There is a difference for __auto_type between clang and GCC.
For GCC the identifier is not declared until after the
initialization while for clang this is an error.  


C23 Issue: auto is still a storage-class specifier and not
a type specifier.
